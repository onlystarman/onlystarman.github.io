What is S3?
=============



S3 is abbreviation of Simple Storage Service.

In short, this is a service which provides us a space where we can save files.

One of the most common ways of saving files is running a server using harddisk or SSD.

But as you know such HD or SSD can be broke down as the time goes by.

Then our files saved on it would be lost or cracked.

Amazon promises 99.999999999% of durability which is an exact calculated number.

Thats why Amazon provides this service and why people use this service.

Also, think about using a private server like 1TB of HD.

At first we usually don't use all of this storage rather we only use small portion of it.

But think about how much we paid for this storage.

We payed for 1TB of harddisk machine which is very expensive and it is a very uneffective way of using money.

S3 provides us to use it more elastically, as they charge only for the actual storage we used.

And also in some cases, there's an file such as we don't have to access very often. Such as an legal document which we have to save it for like 5 years. The Original storage services charged us for same money whether we use it everyday or once in a decade. But S3 provides more cheaper plans for these kind of files.
