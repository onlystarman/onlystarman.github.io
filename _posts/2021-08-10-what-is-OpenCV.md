OpenCV is an abreviation of 'Open Source Computer Vision Library'.

It is a very convenient library we can use freely for coding computer vision codes.

OpenCV was first developed by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and Itseez.

As Intel acquired Itseez, it is simple to say that OpenCV is supported by Intel.
