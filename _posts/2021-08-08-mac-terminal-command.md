Today I'm going to introduce several key commands you can use on the mac terminal.
I'm going to update this post everytime I found some commands important.

First open 'terminal' application which is basically installed on your mac.

You'll find this kind of screen feature.

I've installed an 'Anaconda' which enables us to use an virtual envirenment so the terminal text starts with '(base)' but it doesn't matter if your terminal starts with the user name of your mac.

Type these commands on your terminal and check how it works.

A command '**cd**' enables you to change directory where you are at.
'~ %' means you are not at a home directory. Usually this directory is an home folder of each Users of your computer. Check how it works

press 'Enter'

My directory has been changed to 'localcoding'
This is possible only when the folder name of the directory is present in your current directory.

You might find out that it is really annoying job to type full name of the folder everytime you want to change a directory.

Then try this way.

Just type a fraction of your directory name which is on a current directory and press '**Tab**' on your keyboard.

Then rest of the directory name will be typed perfectlly and automatically.

When you want to move to an upper directory type '**cd ..**'

And If you want to go back to the home directory, then type '**cd ~**'

![cdhome](/assets/images/20210808/cdhome.png)

IF you want to check a list of files and folders on a current directory type '**ls**'

You might think there is to many texts on your terminal so you want to erase it. In that case, type '**clear**'

If you want to open a file type '**open**'
type a file name behind the command 'open' then file would be opened.

Like this!

If you want to see a current directory where you are at, type '**pwd**'

If you want to create a new file, type '**touch**' and put a file name behind it. I made an indexxxxx.html file on a current directory.

Look how it worked. New file has been created.
