Before we jump into MySQL we need to think about why and for what MySQL has come out.

Right after the first computer has been made, people using a computer needed an effective way to save data.

Therefore, a very familiar system has been developed whose name is 'file'.

At the first time when the 'file' system has come out, People were satisfied enough as they can handle their data easily.

But as the scale of the data has been bigger and bigger, people wanted a more convenient tool for handling their data.

Imagine you were in the times when there was no database software and when the only tool existing for handling data was 'file'. You have your own business and have to manage files about your customers.

Unless your business is extremely small, you might have a large number of customers, and handling all of these data would be a hard job.

Such as rearranging your customer's data according to the date of their registration.

As there is no database software, You have to open every single file of your data and compare the customer's registration date and you also have to rearrange it following to date.




Many scientists thought that this was an ineffective way to handle data, so they tried to develop a new software where they could arrange, classify, create, read, update, delete data effectively.

According to these kinds of needs, the software they made was MySQL which is now one of the biggest database software in the world.

But one might have a question.

If the purpose of MySQL is for handling data, people might wonder what's the difference between Excel and MySQL.

One of the biggest differences among the two is that you can handle data on MySQL by code, where Excel doesn't.

This is a crucial difference because if you can code lines for handling data, you can automate most of the parts of your tasks which you have to do on your own before using such software as MySQL.
