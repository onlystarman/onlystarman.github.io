OpenCV is an abreviation of 'Open Source Computer Vision Library'.

It is a convenient library we can use freely for coding computer vision codes.

OpenCV was first developed by Intel and later supported by Willow Garage and Itseez which was later acquired by Intel again.

You might have seen camera applications such as detecting your face or eyes and collaging interesting mustache or sunglasses. These are the techniqcs where OpenCV has been used.

There are also a lot of algorithms you can use for detecting objects other than facial characteristics you want and it is completely free for use.

OpenCV supports several code languages such as C++, Python, Java and Matlab. So it is usable in various fields.
